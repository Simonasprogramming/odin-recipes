    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meatballs are one of my favorite weeknight dinner categories for their ease and endless adaptations. They’re simple to make and, if done well, can be so flavorful. Plus, they also make for a great meal prepping for the week. The only annoying thing about them? Forming each individual meatball, over and over again. Enter: these jumbo-sized meatballs.</li>
        <li>You only have to form 4 of them, cutting the recipe prep time down by at least a third. The large meatballs are then slow-roasted in marinara sauce to make them tender and oh-so-tasty. The key to a good meatball is making sure you don’t overwork the meat. Try to mix the meat gently and only do so until all of the mix-ins feel incorporated. No need to keep going, or your meatballs will come out tough. Think of your meat like flour in cookies: the more you mix it and work the dough, the tougher they turn out.</li>
        <li>The meatballs are big enough to split in half and best served over your favorite pasta. I love it with a bucatini, but you can never go wrong with classic spaghetti. Just don’t forget a shower of Parmesan on top. </li>
        <li>These meatballs can shaped the day before and kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator or frozen for up to 1 month.</li>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. ground beef (preferably 80% lean)</li>
        <li>1 lb. ground pork</li>
        <li>2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup finely shredded or grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy ovenproof pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add tomatoes and water and stir to combine. Add basil and oregano; season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer, stirring often, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced and flavors have melded, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce oven temperature to 325°. Transfer meatballs to marinara and spoon sauce over.</li>
        <li>Continue to bake until meatballs are cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 165°, about 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve meatballs with pasta. Spoon more sauce over. Top with Parmesan.</li>
