        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>I don’t know about you, but I want chicken Parm all the time. Luckily, with this one-pot recipe, I can meet my weekly chicken Parm quota while also feeding a crowd. Chicken Parm is a staple of Italian-American cuisine, and while it’s usually served on the side of or over spaghetti, I thought that cavatappi would not only add texture, but would make pasta a central player here. I used store-bought breaded chicken breasts and tomato sauce so you don’t have to do any heavy lifting. The goal of this recipe is for you to have 0% less stress and 100% more chicken Parm. Because honestly, at the end of the day, that’s all any of us is really looking for, right?</li>
         </ul>
         <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
         <ul>
            <li>Frozen Chicken: Because this dish makes pasta the star of the show, I decided to use store-bought, frozen breaded chicken cutlets. Cook them ahead of time, let cool, and slice, then they’re ready to go.</li>
            <li>Cavatappi: I decided to go for cavatappi to add some welcome texture, but any short pasta would work great here.</li>
            <li>Extra-Virgin Olive Oil: Use your favorite brand, or check out the list of the best (and worst!) olive oil brands.</li>
            <li>Onion & Garlic: A small yellow onion and two cloves of garlic add a surprising amount of flavor to our store-bought sauce—don’t skip it.</li>
            <li>Marinara Sauce: Again, I chose to go the store-bought route again here to make this as easy as possible, but if you’ve got the time, our homemade marinara is really something special.</li>
            <li>Parmesan & Mozzarella: A mixture of Parmesan and mozzarella create the cheesy, rich vibes here. Plus, chicken Parmesan just wouldn’t be the same without them. I highly recommend freshly grating your cheese for the best possible flavor and melty texture.</li>
            <li>Basil: This is peak rich comfort food, and some torn heavy basil on top provides a fresh boost that really elevates every bite.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, cook your frozen chicken according to the package instructions. Once done and crispy, let them cool, then cut crosswise into strips. Set them aside until your pasta is ready. Heat the oven to 400°.</li>
            <li>Time to prepare the pasta. In a large pot of boiling salted water (don’t be afraid to salt heavily), cook the pasta—stirring occasionally so nothing sticks—until al dente according to the package directions. Drain, then set aside while you make the sauce.</li>
            <li>In a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, heat up some oil. Cook the onion until translucent and softened—this should take about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, making sure to stir frequently. Add the marinara and 1 tsp. salt, then bring the sauce to a low simmer.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta to the skillet and stir to fully coat in the sauce. Add 1/2 cup Parmesan and toss until it fully melts in the pasta.</li>
            <li>Top with the remaining Parmesan, then pile on the mozzarella. Arrange your cooked, sliced chicken breasts on top of the pasta before placing in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake until the cheese is fully melted and the chicken is warmed through—this should take around 10 to 12 minutes. Finish it off with a bit of pepper, basil, and more Parmesan before serving.</li>
        </ol>
